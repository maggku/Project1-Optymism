# PROJECT1 - OPTYMISM

# Optimism vs Arbitrum Ecosystems  

This website focuses on **Optimism**, a Layer 2 solution designed to make **Ethereum** faster and cheaper. It compares **Optimism** and **Arbitrum** — both use **Optimistic Rollups** to solve Ethereum's high transaction fees and slow speeds.  

## What is Ethereum?  
Ethereum is a decentralized network that allows developers to build applications that run without intermediaries like banks or servers. It uses blockchain technology to securely record data and transactions, enabling **smart contracts** — self-executing programs that automate tasks.    

## Who is this for?  
- **Developers**: Building dApps on Ethereum using Layer 2 solutions.  
- **Crypto Enthusiasts/Investors**: Learning about Optimism and exploring investment opportunities.  
- **Existing Projects & DAOs**: Teams evaluating scalable and affordable Ethereum-based solutions.  
- **Researchers/Analysts**: Studying Layer 2 technology and Ethereum scaling.  

## Main Goal  
To provide clear educational content and technical resources, catering to both beginners and developers as crypto concepts are still new to many.  


## Project Description
This project is a modern webpage built with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. Initially, the website featured a gradient-styled layout and a **Subscribe Section** where users could input their email addresses to subscribe for updates. To improve usability, I made the website **responsive**, using **Bootstrap components** to make it mobile-friendly and accessible on all screen sizes. The gradient background and subscribe button were removed to simplify the design, and the website was deployed to GitHub Pages.

## UX Development
- **Figma**: The user experience design for this project was created using [Figma](https://www.figma.com/). You can view the design stages, including the prototypes and development process, by following the link below:

This design process helped shape the final implementation and layout of the website.

## Changes Made
- **Responsive Design**: The website was transformed to be fully responsive using Bootstrap components to ensure it works seamlessly across all devices (desktops, tablets, and mobile phones).
- **Removal of Gradient Backgrounds**: I removed the gradient-styled background from various sections of the site to create a cleaner, more modern look.
- **Removal of Subscribe Button**: The subscription form was removed to simplify the site and improve user experience.
- **GitHub Deployment**: The website was deployed to GitHub Pages, allowing users to access it live.
